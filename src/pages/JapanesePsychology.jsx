              <p className="text-gray-700 text-[15px] leading-relaxed mb-4">
                In the modern World, many of us feel caught in a relentless cycle of the hustle, the constant stream of digital information, and the pervasive feeling of{" "}
                <strong>"cultural future shock."</strong> We are disconnected from our bodies, our purpose, and the present moment, which is leading to burnout, anxiety, and deep dissatisfaction.

            The Pillars of Japanese Balance: Timeless Concepts for Modern Life
          </h2>
          <p className="text-[15px] text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-10">
            At the heart of this philosophy are five powerful, actionable concepts that fundamentally shift your relationship with work, self, and the world.
          </p>

          <div className="mb-10">
            <h3 className="text-[16px] font-bold text-black mb-3">1. Ikigai (生き甲斐): The Joy of Purpose</h3>
            <p className="text-[15px] text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
              Translated as "a reason for being," Ikigai is the deep, innate sense of fulfillment that comes from engaging with life. It is often visualized as the intersection of four core areas:
            </p>
            <ul className="text-[15px] text-gray-700 space-y-1 mb-4 ml-2">
              <li>What you love</li>
              <li>What you are good at</li>
              <li>What the world needs</li>
              <li>What you can be paid for</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-[15px] text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              For hustle-loving generation constantly searching for "meaning" and career satisfaction, Ikigai provides a focused and holistic map. It shifts the emphasis from financial success to integrated and sustainable joy.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="mb-10">
            <h3 className="text-[16px] font-bold text-black mb-3">2. Wabi-Sabi (侘寂): The Beauty of Imperfection</h3>
            <p className="text-[15px] text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
           Wabi-Sabi is an aesthetic and philosophical concept that celebrates the beauty of things that are imperfect, impermanent, and incomplete. It is about appreciating the natural cycle of growth and decay and finding elegance in simplicity.</p>
            <p className="text-[15px] text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Wabi-Sabi is the ultimate counter to perfectionism and the curated “highlight reel” culture of social media. It fosters self-compassion and acceptance by reframing flaws as character and history.</p>
          </div>

          <div className="mb-10">
            <h3 className="text-[16px] font-bold text-black mb-3">3. Kaizen (改善): Continuous, Incremental Improvement</h3>
            <p className="text-[15px] text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Kaizen translates to “change for the better” or “continuous improvement.” It is the principle that significant goals are achieved not through massive, radical overhauls, but through consistent, small, manageable steps.</p>
              <p className="text-[15px] text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">This approach is indispensable for rewiring habits and managing stress. Instead of failing at a massive New Year’s resolution, Kaizen encourages you to take a “one-minute action” every day. This consistency builds momentum and reduces the fear of failure.</p>
          </div>

          <div className="mb-10">
            <h3 className="text-[16px] font-bold text-black mb-3">4. Shinrin-yoku (森林浴): Forest Bathing and Stress Relief</h3>
            <p className="text-[15px] text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Often translated as “forest bathing,” this is the practice of simply being calm and quiet among the trees, connecting with nature using all five senses. It is not about hiking or exercise but it is about mindful immersion.</p>
          <p className="text-[15px] text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Backed by science, Shinrin-yoku lowers the stress hormone, reduces blood pressure, and improves immune function. It is a necessary physical antidote to the screen time overload that defines modern anxiety.</p>
