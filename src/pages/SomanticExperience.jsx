                Why Stress Gets Trapped in Your Nervous System?
              </h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700 text-[15px] leading-relaxed mb-4">
                You've tried to <em>think</em> your way out of stress, anxiety, or past trauma but the symptoms persist like chronic tension, a racing heart, digestive issues, or suddenly feeling overwhelmed. This is your body's natural, protective response to the threat of the{" "}
                <strong>"fight and flight response"</strong> that couldn't fully reveal itself during the original event.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 text-[15px] leading-relaxed mb-4">
                <strong>Somatic Experiencing (SE)</strong> pioneered by <strong>Dr. Peter A. Levine</strong>, is the bottom-up approach that addresses this root cause. It operates on the principle that trauma is an experience stored in your physiology.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 text-[15px] leading-relaxed">
                In simple terms, SE helps your body complete the natural self-protective responses that were interrupted, restoring your nervous system's natural ability to regulate itself.
